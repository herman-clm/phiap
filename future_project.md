## Future Project Thoughts

* tools for creative ideas
    * timeline plots, spaghetti plots
    * notes timeline
    * histograms?  clustering?
* what else can we diagnose? PA? What else
* what can we create that is new rather than validation
* how can we take better advantage of longitudinal data
* Predict aldosteronism in patients based on EHR data.
 * First: use existing aldostorone identifying guidelines, implement those using SQL and PennDataStore (or any other relevent PennMedicine data resources)
 * Eventually: build a model independent of guidelines to predict aldosteronism as well as possible
