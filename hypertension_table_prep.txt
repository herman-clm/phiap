BP MEASUREMENTS:
2_enc_1000_mrn.csv
using outpatient only


DIAGNOSIS:
2_icd9diag.csv - only hypertension diags, not all diags
TODO - need new query that gives ALL the ICD9 codes for each patient in the cohort, not just the hypertension ICD9 codes, CONFIRM THIS WITH DAN

MEDICATIONS:
2_meds.csv

REGEX IN NOTES:
TODO…

HYPERTENSION MEDS:
Done! on lothal

HYPERTENSION ICD9s:
simple! 405%, 401%

BP MEASUREMENT:
systolic >=140 and/or dias >=90
a little ambiguous
Dan recommends using AND despite previously using or



??Definition of Hypertensive


####### FILE DESCRIPTIONS
2_enc_1000_mrn.csv - all blood pressure measurements for each patient in the cohort

2_icd9diag.csv - for each cohort patient, ICD9 diagnosis ONLY HT

2_meds.csv - for each cohort patient, all meds including non HT

export.org - Results from Dan’s first query from resistant_htl.sql, medications on the patient/encounter level




#TODO


SUNIL
get SQL data on gitlab

SUNIL - SELAH MAKE TICKET
2_meds
	want STATUS_MASTER_DESC for STATUS=SEND filter
	want ORDER_PROVIDER order.provider_id,authorize_provider helps to know if medication is current or historical
		want order provider as well as episode provider (and perhaps others)
	do this for the SAME 1000 MRN cohort
	all medication, likes

SUNIL - SELAH MAKE TICKET
ICD9s pull out ALL ICD9s for each cohort patient


Notes… no parsing, just use regex from notes, display what comes out
patient/regex result

patient level table with some features that we are constructing
	eg unique ICD9 counts, etc…

FOR TICKETS
** in subject put “IBI request for Sunil Thomas”

Plan new meeting ~3 weeks


NICE TO HAVES

connect Dan with Clarity Data Dictionary


SUNIL - SELAH MAKE TICKET
Notes… potentially recreate, but concatenate with ‘\n’

investigate SNOMED concept identifier

investigate KNIME, will this do Regex and NLP for us

BIC - what do they use?  asana?  gitlab? issues in gitlab?
